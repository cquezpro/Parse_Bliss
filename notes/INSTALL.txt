You can use Bliss as a local web app.

1) Set up a local webserver pointing to bliss web root (i.e. /var/www/bliss) and 
a virtual host so that 

bliss.local/

Is pointing to /var/www/bliss/index.php


EXAMPLE VIRTUAL HOST CONFIG:

<VirtualHost *:80>
        ServerAdmin admin@opentactics.com
        ServerName bliss.local 
        DirectoryIndex index.php
        DocumentRoot /var/www/bliss

    <Directory />
        AllowOverride All
    </Directory>
</VirtualHost>


2) Add bliss.local to point to 127.0.0.1 in your hosts config file


3) Go to bliss.local/ui/forms/LoginForm.htm

user: test@opentactics.com
pass: test

(Login form will simply reload, you are now logged in)

4) View all forms / exercises at:

http://bliss.local/


That is the easiest way to work with most things.  You can also install as an unpacked Chrome extension. See:
