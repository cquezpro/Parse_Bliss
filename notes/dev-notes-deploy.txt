The way that forms and exercises actually get deployed in the chrome extension is through ui/deploy/deploy.htm

For instance, to deploy the Gratitude Journal exercise you would go to 

http://bliss.local/ui/deploy/deploy.htm?exercise=GratitudeExercise

Basically this allows us to circumvent some javascript security restrictions and also display multiple forms / exercises in a series, one after another i.e:
http://bliss.local/ui/deploy/deploy.htm?exercise=GettingStartedForm,GratitudeExercise

(Displays Gratitude Exercise after Getting Started form is submitted)

deploy.htm is created by deploy.php

deploy.php includes a number of files:

    <?php require_once('core.includes.php'); ?>
    <!-- Exercises -->
    <?php require_once('exercises.includes.php'); ?>
    <!-- Trackers -->
    <?php require_once('track.includes.php'); ?>
    <!-- Forms -->
    <?php require_once('forms.includes.php'); ?>
    <!-- Deploy -->

To build the new deploy.htm you would modify deploy.php - or one of the includes php files, and then run

php deploy.php > deploy.htm


This means that the exercise css files and the forms css files are both included whenever an exercise or form is deployed - so we must target selectors to avoid conflicts
